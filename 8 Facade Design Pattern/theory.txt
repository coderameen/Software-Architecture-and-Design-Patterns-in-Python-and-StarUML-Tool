Q. Design and Implement a Façade pattern for home theatre system?

The Façade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with the system. In the case of a home theatre system, which might involve multiple components like a projector, sound system, Blu-ray player, and lights, the Façade pattern can provide a single interface to control all of them.

Scenario:
We have several components in a Home Theatre System:

Projector
Sound System
Blu-ray Player
Lights
The Façade will provide a single interface for turning on/off the system, starting a movie, and stopping a movie, without the client needing to deal with the complexities of each individual component.


Real-world Use Case:
The Façade Pattern is useful in real-world scenarios where you need to simplify interactions with complex systems. In this example, the home theatre system contains several components, and the Façade provides an easy way for the user to control all these components without needing to interact with them individually.

In a real-life home automation system, the Façade could integrate with smart home devices to manage lighting, audio, video, and other appliances, allowing the user to control everything through a simple interface.
