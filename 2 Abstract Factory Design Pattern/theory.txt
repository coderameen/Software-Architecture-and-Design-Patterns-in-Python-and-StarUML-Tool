Q. Design and Implement an AbstractFactory class to create families of related or dependent objects with respect to decathlon store without specifying their concrete classes using Abstract Factory?
ANS:
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. In the context of a Decathlon store, this could involve creating related products, such as sports equipment (e.g., shoes, jerseys, etc.) for different sports categories (e.g., football, basketball).

Here's a Python implementation of the Abstract Factory for Decathlon:
1. Abstract Factory Interface
Provides methods to create related objects (e.g., shoes, jerseys).
2. Concrete Factories
Concrete factories for specific sports like FootballFactory and BasketballFactory, each producing related products (e.g., football shoes and football jerseys, basketball shoes and basketball jerseys).
3. Product Interfaces
Abstract products (e.g., Shoes, Jersey) define a set of methods that all product types should implement.
4. Concrete Products
Concrete products like FootballShoes, BasketballShoes, etc., implement the product interfaces.




Real-world Use Case:
The Abstract Factory pattern is useful in situations where you need to create a set of related objects that must be used together, such as in a Decathlon store where each sport (e.g., football, basketball) has its own set of equipment and clothing that must be consistent within that category.
